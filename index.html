<!-- Rock paper scissors game

    Project putting to practice fundamental js skills including:
    - using operators and conditional statements (incl. if else and switch);
    - working with existing js methods (e.g. to modify strings);
    - defining and invoking functions, using the return value and understanding function scope;
    - writing clean code with pseudocode to explain logic;
    - using git and github for version control;
    - using the Developer tools to troubleshoot.

The game will be played only from the console, so link to .js file and keep html as is.
